Module 3 Challenge has two Python challenges - PyBank and PyPoll.

Resources folders that contain the dataset, the CSV file.
The analysis folders contain the results file.

## PyBank
The dataset has two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

![example](https://github.com/wemlaztdj/python-challenge/blob/main/Screenshot/budget_data.png)

The Python script will calculate:

The total number of months included in the dataset.

The total net amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes.

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

and export a text file with the results.

The total number of votes cast.

A complete list of candidates who received votes.

The percentage of votes each candidate won.

The total number of votes each candidate won.
